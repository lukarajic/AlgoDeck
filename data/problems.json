    "solution": "An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. We can solve this by sorting both strings and checking if they are equal. Alternatively, we can use a hash map to count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the maps.",
